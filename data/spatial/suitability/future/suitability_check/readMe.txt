This script serves to check whether the habitat suitability files for the SSP5-8.5 scenario were different, because, unlike what happens with the files for the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the differences are not very noticeable.


The comparison of the image "SPECIES_check.png" refers to the habitat suitability of the SPECIES. The images "PFT11.png", "PTF13.png" and "PTF15.png" represent land use layers where the differences between the timesteps where more noticeable.
