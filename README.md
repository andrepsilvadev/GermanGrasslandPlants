# MetaRange

Folder structure: 
1. data - This directory contains the raw data used for the project.

2. input - This directory holds any intermediate files or data transformations that are generated during the analysis process. 

3. output - This directory stores the final results of the analysis, such as saved models, figures, and tables.

4. src - This directory contains the R and julia scripts that perform the data analysis and modeling. Organize the scripts into subdirectories based on their purpose or function. For example, you might have subdirectories for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

5. rmarkdown - This directory holds R Markdown documents that generate reports, presentations, or other documentation. R Markdown combines R code, text, and other elements to create dynamic documents.

6. README.md - This file provides a brief overview of the project, including the purpose, data sources, and analysis steps. It serves as a starting point for anyone new to the project.
